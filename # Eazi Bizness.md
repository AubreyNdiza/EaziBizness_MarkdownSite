Target Market | Description | Example
------------- | ----------- | --------
Aspiring & Existing Entrepreneurs | These are entrepreneurs who have little knowledge about running a business and are not clued up on certain aspects of running a business i.e. financial management, admin etc. These would be the clients who would use the technology as a form of guidance for them to run their businesses successfully. | A software developer that has come up with a wonderful idea and develops it into a tech-startup, however does not know how to start & run the business. They would use the app to handle all the processes of the business that are needed to grow from a tech-startup to a sustainable business. This also allows them to focus on developing their software while the IoT takes care of other business processes.
Small Business Owners | These are business owners with SMEs that are already running, with operations and systems in place to make the business productive. They are owners with businesses that already have management structures to control the daily operations, however the business still needs investment or funding to expand or grow. The business owners would use the technology to allow them to oversee and control daily business operations on their phones or laptops while they’re out of office meeting with potential investors. The technology would also provide them with live data to show the productivity and value of their business thus far. | A BPO Call Center owner who’s business provides telemarketing services to financial service providers. He would already have a few campaigns running in his call center as “departments”, each with a manager control its operations. As he is planning to pitch for a new campaign, he spends most of his time out of office, pitching to investors to fund his campaign expansion, however he still needs to know and control what happens daily in his other “departments”. The technology would be a solution for him to have live feeds of what is happening in each of his departments daily, such as sales closed, leads generated, revenue created, referrals made etc. The owner would also be needing to show to the investors he’s approaching, how his business is running. The technology provides the owner with live data to support how successful the business is i.e. financial graphs, sales charts, productivity metrics etc.
Serial Entrepreneurs | Entrepreneurs who have started and run more than one business and require a solution for them to monitor every aspect of their business on one platform. The technology would allow them to manage all their businesses as different “departments” on one platform, for seamless control over daily business operations. | A serial entrepreneur with two businesses. One a construction business, the other a consultancy business. Both businesses are run by management that he’s hired, however all management reports to him. Both businesses have different systems set in place for daily operations. The technology will allow him to have an overview of how each business is operated separately, also with a comparison of the two businesses. This will help him to make crucial decisions for each business individually and for both businesses as a collective. When approaching investors, he could be able to pitch both businesses as potential investors would be attracted to the level of transparency and control that he maintains in his businesses.
VCs & Angel Investors | Venture Capitalists & Angel Investors usually have many businesses which they have invested in, and always need to know what happens to their investments, so they can monitor if the business is working according to the agreements of the investment. Our technology will be a solution for them to maintain transparency across all the businesses that they have investments in, by controlling all these businesses on one platform and using live feeds of data. | A VC with diversified investments in startups that operate in different industries i.e. tech, logistics, construction & agriculture. The reason for diversification for this VC is mainly just for her to see which of these industries is the next cash cow. Having a platform to monitor all these investments, pretty much gives her a share-trading kind of feel, with live data of how each investment is doing as compared to others, and how significant that is, relevant to its industry.
Multi-national businesses | Businesses with branches in many countries that find it hard to maintain a working culture across all branches. Managers find it hard to make mutual decisions across all branches, due to lack of live data to base decisions on. These businesses would need the technology to maintain and control a simultaneous culture of daily business operations across all branches, and each manager in each branch can use data from other branches to guide them on making decisions in their branch. The technology will also allow the board of directors to closely monitor and control the whole business seamlessly. | Meltwater, a media analysis company with over 50 offices across the globe. Jorn, owner of Meltwater believes strongly in maintaining the same working culture across all his offices. The technology will allow Jorn to ensure that all 50 of his offices maintain the same culture as in Silicon Valley, through close monitoring and live feeds. It will also allow him to maintain the constant communication he holds with his management teams across all offices. The data provided by the technology can also be transparent to investors to access and make decisions on their investment at the company.
